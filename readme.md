# BrattleExtras: An R Package for Handy Brattle Functions

## Introduction
This package is designed to provide R functions and other objects commonly used in Brattle projects. Currently, the primary use is for implementing Brattle style in ggplot figures. 

**None of the objects in the package contain privileged or confidential information.**

## Contributing
All staff members are invited to submit objects for inclusion. To make a submission:
+ Submit the object
+ Submit a working example
+ Ensure that the object and example are *NOT* privileged or confidential.

These materials can be e-mailed to Charlie Gibbons. These objects should be broadly useful at Brattle, rather than fulfill a niche need. If accepted for inclusion, you will be asked to complete a simple help file for the package documentation and submit the code and documentation to the Github repository.

## Installation
To install the package, first install `devtools` as you normally would. Then, install `BrattleExtras` using `devtools::install_github('Brattle/BrattleExtras')`. If this doesn't work, [download a zip file of this repository](https://github.com/Brattle/BrattleExtras/archive/master.zip), then install using `devtoos::install_local('<path to zip file>')`

## Examples and documentation
See the vignette in the package for examples of usage.
